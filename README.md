# Identify-Fraud-From-Enron
Used machine learning to predict which Enron employees committed fraud; as part of my Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity.

Files:
- Enron Submission Questions.pdf - My answers to the questions asked by Udacity as part of this project. It explains my methodology well.
- enron61702insiderpay.pdf - A pdf about all of the data used in this project.
- poi_id.py - My Person of Interest Identifier. A python file that contains my full analysis.
- feature_format.py - Contains helper functions to complete the analysis in poi_id.py.
- final_project_dataset.pkl - The data used in poi_id.py.
- tester.py - A file provided by Udacity, which tests the recall, precision, and f1 score of my Machine Learning.

Note: If you want to experiment with the poi_id.py file, remember to change the paths of any imported files, such as for feature_format.
